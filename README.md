# Ardui-Copter
I developed this fully Arduino-based drone which boasts an impressive 1 km range which is really impressive for a homemade drone. I chose to use Arduino as it was a familiar platform to work and its low cost made it an obvious choice for me. It turned out to be a really challenging task as there was a lack of resources available online. This meant I had to innovate my own clever solutions for the various functions. An example is the controller. I took a USB Flight controller, gutted it, and fashioned my own wireless remote control by adding a radio transmitter to the shell of the controller. 

The Communication is implemented through the use of NRF24 Radio Transmitters and the MULTIWII Serial Protocol.
